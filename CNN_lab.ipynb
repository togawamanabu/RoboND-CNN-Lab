    "In this lab, you'll classify images from the [Fashion-MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist#get-the-data).  The dataset consists of different types of clothing items such as shirts, trousers, sneakers etc. You'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded.  You'll get to apply what you learned and build a model with convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.  At the end, you'll get to see your neural network's predictions on the sample images.\n",
